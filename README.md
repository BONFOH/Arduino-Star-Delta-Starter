# Arduino-Star-Delta-Starter
A simple 3-phase motor Star-Delta starter using an Arduino Uno.

Project idea: to create an arduino uno based 3-phase star-delta motor starter. The starter/controller shall have an emergency stop feature in addition to standard start/stop control. The device will remain blocked until the e-stop is cleared. In addition this starter will be controllable via a Bluetooth app. The status of the starter will be displayed via an LCD screen connected interfaced through I2C.

Repository Organization:

1. This repository contains source code .ino files containing the Arduino program.

2. This repository contains hardware schematic files created in TinyCAD.
